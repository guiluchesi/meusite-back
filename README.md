# Administrative panel built with MEAN Stack.

## Used in this project:
- HTML
- SASS
- AngularJS
- Express
- Node

## What is this project?
It is an administrative panel that I am developing for my website that use a Mongo database, the back-end runs with Express/Node and the front-end is AngularJs.

## Observations:
This project is still ongoing, but I intent to share it with the community whenever it is done. I decided to create it because the only similar JavaScript based CMS that I found was [Keystone.js](http://keystonejs.com), which isn't what I wanted, so I imagined there is some other people that may need the solution I can offer.
